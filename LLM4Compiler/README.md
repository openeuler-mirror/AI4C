# LLM4Compiler: For the Next-generation Innovation of Compilers and Code Optimization in the Era of LLM.

**[SUBMODULES]**:
   1. **VecTrans**: Iterative Refinement LLM Code Optimization Agent Framework for LLVM Auto-vectorization.
   2. ... ...

> Notes: The developed **VecTrans** agent framework is initially built on [self-refine](https:selfrefine.info). However, we extended more feedback sources to be integrated into the agent, and enhanced the code optimization capability for LLVM-based compilers.
